# Cowpanion - helpful cow-based desktop companion & Webex bot

((demo GIF here))

Works on OSX and Windows*!

(*Tk windows on Windows don't support the same transparency options as on OSX, so until I move to a new GUI framework, cows have an opaque background. Not the worst thing tbh.)

## Installation & usage (client)

python-cowsay requires python >= 3.8, so this program does too. I could probably drop the dependency since it's only being used for the speech bubble.

```bash
python3 -m pip install python-cowsay
python3 cowpanion-client/cowpanion.py
```

(You may also need to install tkinter/python-tkinter via homebrew if you have a
nonstandard python distro.)

## Configuration (client)

Settings & cow profiles are stored at `~/.cowpanion_profile`. Upon first run,
a default config will be written. New cows can be added by adding to the 'cows'
list.

## Installation (server)

WIP
